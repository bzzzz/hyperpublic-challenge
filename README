Contains my takes on Hyperpublic's challenge problems 1 and 2
(http://hyperpublic.com/challenge). Intended to serve as an aid to
anyone who may have had difficulty coming up a solution, thus the code
was written to be effortless to understand.

Note that the chosen strategies are quite naive. Problem 2, in particular,
uses straightforward recursion to derive the minimum needed tasks for 0 to 196
points; improving upon this using dynamic programming is left as an exercise
to the reader.
